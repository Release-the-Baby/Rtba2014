# Equipment required

Any type of Operating System with installed R studio and R.

# Exercises

This practical contains 4 exercises. Write the correct R code for at
least one exercise and submit the code as an R script file (your
matriculation number should be the file name) to the LumiNUS by the end
of the lecture.

# Introduction

In this practical session, you'll become familiar with R, the one of
best programming languages used for spatial analytics. Once you become
comfortable working with R, it would be very easy to dive into spatial
analytics. In spatial data analysis, we have to apply the same set of
commands repeatedly. Such as applying the same algorithm to different
data, different attributes, create maps based on different conditions so
on. R supports such repeated actions via functions, loops, conditions,
etc. According to that, this practical session aims to provide some
basic programming principles and routines in R.

# 1 The Basic Ingredients of R

## Assignment

➼ R_object \<- value\
➼ R_object is a variable. The sign "\<-" assign a value to the R object.
This also called as "gets". That is R_object gets value\
➼ Also "=" equal sing can be used as an alternative. But this performs
the soft assignment.\
➼ The basic assignment type is R is to a vector of values\
1.Individual values x \<-10, y \<-100, or z\<-x OR\
2.Multiple values a \<- c(10, 100, 200)

## Other operations/functions

➼ Sum\
➼ Mean\
➼ Max etc\

# 2 Data Types and Data classes

## A. Data Types

➼ Data in R organized into a hierarchy of data types\
➼ Each of the types associated with a test and a conversion function\

1.  Test: to check the whether the used value is given data type, this
    will return TRUE or\
    FALSE\
2.  Conversion: to convert the used value to the given data type\
    ![](img/01.01.DataType.png)

### Numeric data type: conversion and test

```{r}
# create numeric object 
numeric(8)

# conversions
as.numeric(c("1980","−8","Geography"))
as.numeric(c(FALSE,TRUE))

# tests
is.numeric(c(8, 8))
is.numeric(c(8, 8, 8, "8"))
```

### Logical data type: conversion and test

```{r}
logical(7)
# conversion
as.logical(c(7,5,0,−4,5))
# TRUE and FALSE can be converted to 1 and 0
as.logical(c(7,5,0,−4,5)) ∗ 1
as.logical(c(7,5,0,−4,5)) + 0
# different ways to declare TRUE and FALSE
as.logical(c("True","T","FALSE","Raspberry","9","0", 0))

```

## B. Data Classes

### i. Vectors

Vectors are the commonly used data structure and the standard one
dimensional R variable Creating a vector\
a. When specifying a character or logical\
b. Using the function of vector (provided the length and mode)

```{r}
# defining vectors
vector(mode = "numeric", length = 8)
vector(length = 8)
# testing and conversion
tmp <- data.frame(a=10:15, b=15:20)
class(tmp)
is.vector(tmp)
as.vector(tmp)
class(tmp)
tmp
```

### ii. Matrix

1\. Defining a matrix: matrix (ncol =3, nrow= 2)\
2. Checking tmp in the above example is a matrix : is.matrix(temp)\
3. Convert tmp into matrix : as.matrix (temp)\
4. Naming matrix rows and columns

```{r}
flow <- matrix(c(2000, 1243, 543, 1243, 212, 545, 654, 168, 109), 
               c(3,3), 
               byrow=TRUE)
# Rows and columns can have names, not just 1,2,3,...
colnames(flow) <- c("Leeds", "Maynooth", "Elsewhere")
rownames(flow) <- c("Leeds", "Maynooth", "Elsewhere")
flow
```

```{r}
# and functions exist to summarise
outflows <- rowSums(flow)
outflows
```

### iii. Factors

1\. Factor can define levels for the parameter.\
2. Therefore factors are useful when data values fall into one of a
number of predefined classes.\
3. Both is.factor and as.factor can be applied to test and convert
vectors.\
4. Table function will count total data values under each level

```{r}
# a vector assignment
house.type <- c("Bungalow", "Flat", 
                "Flat", "Detached", 
                "Flat", "Terrace", 
                "Terrace")

# a factor assignment
house.type <- factor(c("Bungalow", "Flat", "Flat", "Detached", 
                       "Flat", "Terrace", "Terrace"), 
                     levels=c("Bungalow","Flat","Detached",
                              "Semi","Terrace"))
house.type
writeLines('\ncall table') # insert blank line 
# table can be used to summarise
table(house.type)
writeLines('') # insert blank line 

# levels controls what can be assigned
house.type <- factor(c("People Carrier", "Flat", "Flat", 
                       "Hatchback", "Flat", "Terrace","Terrace"), 
                     levels=c("Bungalow","Flat","Detached",
                              "Semi","Terrace"))
house.type
```

### iv. List

1\. List can have different data types together in a single data
structure.\
2. Similar to the other classes list also available with as.list and
is.list functions\
3. In addition it includes append and lapply functions\
a. append: two lists can be joined together\
b. lapply : can apply different functions to each element of a list

```{r}
tmp.list <- list("Lex Comber",
                 c(2015, 2018), 
                 "Lecturer", 
                 matrix(c(6,3,1,2), c(2,2)))
tmp.list
writeLines('\nSelect element 4:')
# elements of the list can be selected
tmp.list[[4]]
writeLines('')
append(tmp.list, list(c(7,6,9,1)))
writeLines('')
tmp
writeLines('')
# lapply with different functions
lapply(tmp.list[[2]], is.numeric)
writeLines('')
lapply(tmp.list, length)
```

### v. data.frame

1\. data frame classes can hold different data types in different
columns\
2. Data.frame includes series of vectors of equal length (columns)\
3. Data.frame function default encodes character strings into factors\
4. To overcome this the df can be defined using stringsAsFactors = False

```{r}
df <- data.frame(dist = seq(0,400, 100), 
                 city = c("Leeds", "Nottingham", 
                          "Leicester", "Durham","Newcastle"))
str(df)
writeLines('')

df$city
writeLines('')

df <- data.frame(dist = seq(0,400, 100), 
                 city = c("Leeds", "Nottingham", 
                          "Leicester", "Durham","Newcastle"),
                 stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(df)
writeLines('')

df <- data.frame(dist = seq(0,400, 100), 
                 city = c("Leeds", "Nottingham", 
                          "Leicester", "Durham","Newcastle"),
                 stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
str(df)
```

### vi. tibble

1\. Similar to data.frame tibble also can hold different data types\
2. This is a reworking of the data.frame class.\
3. It is possible to convert between tibble and data.frame\
4. Also functions like\
"names()", "colnames()", "rownames()",\
"length()", "ncol", "nrow()",\
"cbind()", and "rbind()"\
can be used with both tibble and data.frame

```{r}
library(tibble)
```

```{r}
df <- data.frame(dist = seq(0,400, 100), 
                 city = c("Leeds", "Nottingham", 
                          "Leicester", "Durham","Newcastle"),
                 stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(df)
writeLines('')

tb <- tibble(dist = seq(0,400, 100),
city = c("Leeds", "Nottingham", "Leicester", "Durham", "Newcastle"))
#The partial matching behavior in the data.frame.
df$city
writeLines('')

tb$city
writeLines('')

#Column binding operation
cbind(df, Pop = c(700,250,230,150,1200))
df
writeLines('')
```

# 3 Use of condition and loop in a function

As similar to other programming languages R also provides if condition\
➼ In if condition we execute a group of consequent statements together\
➼ Such group of statements is called "code blocks" and curly brackets
are used to group\
them

Also, loops are commonly used in R\
Two types of loops available\
1. Deterministic loop (for loop): Executed fixed number of times
specified at the beginning of\
the loop\
2. Conditional loop (repeat loop): Executed until a specific condition

To group code and reuse it, a function can be written using function()
command\
➼ Wrapping a code block into a function allows it to call anywhere in
the name of the function\
➼ Usually, functions are defined to process the input specified in the
argument list and\
return the result either to a variable or to the console window (rather
than just printing\
something).

\
In the following sample code function is named as "assess.tree.height"
and it is taking two\
arguments named "tree.list" and "thresh".\
➼ End of the function, it returns the mean of the list of tree heights

```{r}
assess.tree.height <- function(tree.list, thresh)
{
  for (i in 1:length(tree.list))
  { 
    if(tree.list[i] < thresh){
      cat('Tree',i, ' is small\n')
      cat('Tree',i,' should not cut\n')
    }else {
      cat('Tree',i,' is large\n')
    }
  }
  return(mean(tree.list))
}

tree.heights <- c(4.3,7.1,6.3,5.2,3.2)
thmean <- assess.tree.height(tree.heights, 6)
```

Example code for a conditional loop

```{r eval=FALSE}
gcd <- function(a,b)
{
  divisor <- min(a,b)
  dividend <- max(a,b)
  repeat
  {
    remainder <- dividend %% divisor
    dividend <- divisor
    divisor <- remainder
    #Loop condition
    if (remainder == 0) 
      break
  }
  return(dividend)
}
```

# 4. Use of seq() in R

To perform a series of R expressions on each row, on each column, or on
each data element of data frames and other similar tabular data
structures, seq() can be used.

➼ Method 1: seq(from, to, by = step value)\
➼ Method 2: seq(from, to, length.out = sequence length)

1\. Exercise (1): Create the same for loop using sequence length.out
function. See whether there is a time difference between by and
length.out functions.

In here "sprintf()" is used to print to a fixed number of decimal
places.

```{r}
for (val in seq(0,1,by=0.25))
{
  val.squared <- val ∗ val
  cat("The square of",val,"is ",val.squared,"\n")
  cat(sprintf("The square of %4.0f is %8.4f \n", val, val.squared))
}

```

## Exercise (1)

```{r}
for (val in seq(0,1,length.out=5))
{
  val.squared <- val ∗ val
  cat("The square of",val,"is ",val.squared,"\n")
  cat(sprintf("The square of %4.0f is %8.4f \n", val, val.squared))
}
```

Statology: How to Use seq Function in R (With Examples)

[source](https://www.statology.org/seq-function-in-r/)

basic syntax: **seq(from=1, to=1, by=1, length.out=NULL,
along.with=NULL)**

where:

**from**: The starting value of the sequence.\
**to**: The end value of the sequence.\
**by**: The value to increment by. Default is 1.\
**length.out**: The desired length of the sequence.\
**along.with:** The desired length that matches the length of this data
object.

**Example 1: Generate Sequence Starting from One** The following code
shows how to generate a sequence of values from 1 to 20:

```{r}
#define sequence
x <- seq(20)
#view sequence
x
```

### **Example 2: Generate Sequence with Specific Start and End Values**

The following code shows how to generate a sequence of values from 5 to
15:

```{r}
#define sequence
x <- seq(from=5, to=15)
#view sequence
x
```

### **Example 3: Generate Sequence with Custom Incrementing**

The following code shows how to generate a sequence of values from 0 to
20, incrementing by **4**:

```{r}
#define sequence
x <- seq(from=0, to=20, by=4)
#view sequence
x
```

### **Example 4: Generate Sequence with Specific Length**

The following code shows how to generate a sequence of values from 0 to
20, where the specified length of the sequence is **4**:

```{r}
#define sequence
x <- seq(from=0, to=20, length.out=4)
#view sequence
x
```

### **Example 5: Generate Sequence with Length Based on Some Data Object**

The following code shows how to generate a sequence of values from 0 to
20, where the specified length of the sequence should match the length
of another data object:

```{r}
#define vector y
y <- c(1, 4, 6, 9)
#define sequence x, make sure length matches the length of y
x <- seq(from=0, to=20, along.with=y)
#view sequence
x

```

Notice that sequence *x* goes from 0 to 20 and its length (4) matches
the length of vector *y*.
:::

# 5. Writing function into a text file

When the function is saved to an R file it can be called and loaded when
you run R

Write functions cube.root() and circle.area() in your script file

``` r
cube.root <- function(x) {
result <- x ^ (1/3)
return(result)}
circle.area <- function(r) {
result <- pi ∗ r ^ 2
return(result)}
```

Select "Save As" option to save the file with the name "functions.R"\
When you want to call the function\
➼ First, load the source file using the source() command\
➼ Then call the relevant function in the source file

```{r}
source('01.dump/functions.R')
cube.root(343)
circle.area(10)
```

# 6. Data checking

This will help to determine whether the data that have been given to the
function are the right kind

So the functions should be able to spot such issues and print a warning
explaining the problem. This will eliminate crashing the code with a
fairly obscure error message

This can be achieved through the "if condition" and "is" checking
(is.numeric())

```{r eval=FALSE}
cube.root <- function(x) {
  if (is.numeric(x)) {
    if (x >= 0) {
      result <- x^(1/3)
    }else{
      result <- -(-x)^(1/3)
    }
    return(result)
  }else{
    cat("WARNING: Input must be numerical, not character\n")
    return(NA)
  }
}
```

# 7. Apply Functions (apply, lapply, and spply)

These functions offer an easier way to interrogate, manipulate, and
summarize spatial data, either by their variable attributes or by their
spatial properties.

➼ Apply functions are quicker than loops.

➼ Also called as group functions which the function can be applied to
the same set of\
operations over each element in a data object (rows, column, list
element)

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages('rgeos', dependencies = TRUE)
install.packages('GISTools_0.7-4.tar.gz', dependencies = TRUE)
```

Following code will load "Newhaven data" and use the "blocks" dataset to
determine which\
ethnicity formed the largest group in each block.

In here apply() function has three arguments,

➼ The first argument find the dataset that the given function is applied
(here it is the 14th to\
17th columns of the blocks data frame)\
14: P_WHITE 15: P_BLACKS 16: P_AMERI_ES 17: P_ASIAN 18: P_OTHERS\
\
➼ The second argument is the margin and when it is equal to 1, it
indicates that apply will\
operate over each row. If it is 2, the function will be applied over
columns\
➼ The third argument is the function that we apply to the selected data
in argument 1\
"which.max" function will identify the largest group\

```{r}
library(GISTools)
data(newhaven)

## the @data route
head(blocks@data[, 14:18])

## the data frame route
#head(data.frame(blocks[, 14:17]))
res.vec <-apply(data.frame(blocks[,14:17]), 1, which.max)
colnames(data.frame(blocks[,14:17]))[res.vec]
```

## Exercise (2)

Using apply function find the size of the largest block of each
ethnicity type and the relevant block id.

```{r}
res.vec <-apply(data.frame(blocks[,14:17]), 2, which.max)
rownames(data.frame(blocks[,14:17]))[res.vec]
```

```{r}
# results makes sense?
checker <- data.frame(blocks)
for(i in 1:length(res.vec)){
  print(checker[res.vec[i],14:18])
}

```

## Exercise (3)

Find the number of blocks available in the dataset using "apply" and
"length" function

Consider georgia data and georgia.polys list. To plot the coordinates of
each element of georgia.polys list:\
i. First plot extent is defined\
ii. Each polygon is plotted in turn using a loop

```{r}
data(georgia)
plot(bbox(georgia2)[1,], 
     bbox(georgia2)[2,], 
     asp = 1, 
     type='n', 
     xlab='', ylab='' )

for (i in 1:length(georgia.polys)){
  points(georgia.polys[[i]], type='l')
  # small delay so that plotting can be seen
  Sys.sleep(0.05)
}
```

# 8. Plots

## A Basic plot tools

i\. The most basic plot is scatter plot\
ii. Can set many option to change the plot environment\
Example: pch: character, col: color of the data points

``` r
plot(x1,y1,pch=16, col=’red’)
```

Option "type=1" will produces a line plot of the two variables. *lwd*
specifies the plot line width. ylim option sets the limits of the
y-axis, while xlim does the same for the x-axis.

*lines* function will add new line to the plot and "lty" specifies the
type of line (dotted, simple,etc.).

```{r}
x2 <- seq(0,2∗pi,len=100)
y2 <- sin(x2)
plot(x2,y2,type='l')
plot(x2,y2,type='l', 
     lwd=3, 
     col='darkgreen')
#Refer the Figure 1
plot(x2,y2,
     type='l', 
     col='darkgreen', 
     lwd=3, 
     ylim=c(−1.2,1.2))

y2r <- y2 + rnorm(100,0,0.1)

points(x2,y2r, 
       pch=16, 
       col='darkred')
y4 <- cos(x2)
plot(x2, y2, 
     type='l', 
     lwd=3, 
     col='darkgreen')
lines(x2, y4, 
      lwd=3, lty=2, 
      col='darkblue')
```

## B Points with Polygons

The function polygon adds a polygon to an existing plot.\
The option col sets the polygon fill colour.\
By default a black border is drawn, but it can be disabled using the
parameter border = NA

When "asp=1" the x and y scales are the same.

type = 'n' draws the plot axes to correct scale (i.e. of the y2 and y4
data) but adds no lines or points.

```{r}
x2 <- seq(0,2∗pi,len=100)
y2 <- sin(x2)
y4 <- cos(x2)
# specify the plot layout and order
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
# plot #1
plot(y2,y4)
polygon(y2,y4,col='lightgreen')
# plot #2
#this time with 'asp' to set the aspect ratio of the axes
plot(y2,y4, asp=1, type='n')
polygon(y2,y4,col='lightgreen')
```

## C Plots with geographical coordinates

Call the "GISTools" package; "library(GISTools)".

*Hint: You should already install this package into your R platform
before calling it.*\

For this practical we will use Georgia datasets in the GISTools package.
This dataset can be loaded using the function "data(georgia)"\
With data(georgia) will load three datasets georgia, georgia2 and
georgia.polys.\
1. From "georgia.polys" dataset we will select the first element to get
the coordinates (Step 4 in code).\
2. If "type='n'" no lines or polygons\
3. "angle=135" defines the angle of the filling line of the polygon

```{r}

library(GISTools)
#2. 
data(georgia)
#3. #select the first element
#4. 
appling <- georgia.polys[[1]]
# appling is a two-column matrix.
#5. # set the plot extent
#6. 
plot(appling, asp=1, type='n', xlab='Easting', ylab="Northing")
#7. # plot the selected features with hatching
#8. 
polygon(appling, density=14, angle=135)

```

Try to replace the line 8 in the code snippet 11 with following code:

i\. rgb represents Red, Green, and Blue values and the last (4th ) value
indicates the transparency (0-invisible to 1-opaque)

ii\. Add "text" function to add some text to the plot, cex (character
expansion) parameter defines the size of text.

```{r}
#4. 
appling <- georgia.polys[[1]]
# appling is a two-column matrix.
#5. # set the plot extent
#6. 
plot(appling, asp=1, type='n', xlab='Easting', ylab="Northing")
#7. # plot the selected features with hatching
#8. 
polygon(appling, col=rgb(0,0.5,0.7,0.4))
text(1287000,1053000,"Appling County",cex=1.5)
text(1287000,1049000,"Georgia",col='darkred')
mtext('Figure 2.5 Appling County with transparency', cex = 1.4)
```

## D Introduction to ggplot

The "ggplot" approach handles each element of the graphic separately in
a series of layers, so it is easy to control each part of the plot.

ggplot2 package is included as part of the tidyverse. So can install
tidyverse package to install ggplot2 or install ggplot2 on its own

ggplot2 has two functions to create plots\
1. qplot(): to produce quick, simple plots.\
2. Figure 1 can be recreated using following code\
3. To add new parameter to the qplot() function + should be added
before.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
qplot(x2,y2r,
      col=I('darkred'), 
      ylim=c(−1.2, 1.2)) +
geom_line(aes(x2,y2), 
          col=I("darkgreen"), 
          size = I(1.5)) +
theme(axis.text=element_text(size=20), 
      axis.title= element_text(size=20,face="bold"))
```

### Different types of plot using ggplot

Set up a dataset which suits for different plotting options

1\. Use the same georgia data frame and convert it to tibble (named it
as "tb" )\
2. Create an indicator for Rural and Non-Rural using following code\
a. Here +0 is used to convert True and False to 1 and 0

```{r}
library(tibble)
```

```{r}
data(georgia)
tb <- as_tibble(georgia)
tb$rural <- as.factor((tb$PctRural > 50) + 0)
levels(tb$rural) <- list("Non-Rural" = 0, "Rural"=1)
```

3\. Then we create an income category variable around the interquartile
range of the MedInc variable (median county income).\
a. The distributions of "IncClass" can be checked using
"table(tb\$IncClass)" command

```{r}
tb$IncClass <- rep("Average", nrow(tb))
tb$IncClass[tb$MedInc >= 41204] = "Rich"
tb$IncClass[tb$MedInc <= 29773] = "Poor"
```

## E Scatter plots

Now draw a scatter plot considering PctBach (percentages of the county
populations with bachelor's degrees) and PctEld (percentages of the
county populations who are elderly).

Follow the code below and see figure

```{r}
ggplot(data = tb, 
       mapping = aes(x = PctBach, y = PctEld)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", 
              col = "red", 
              fill = "lightsalmon") + 
  theme_bw() +
  xlab("% of population with bachelor degree") + 
  ylab("% of population that are elderly")
```

## F Histogram

To examine the distributions of income across the 159 counties of
Georgia a histogram can be drawn as follows

```{r}
ggplot(tb, 
       aes(x=MedInc)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..),
                 binwidth=5000,colour="white") + 
  geom_density(alpha=.4, fill="darksalmon") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=median(MedInc, na.rm=T)), 
             color="orangered1",
             linetype="dashed", 
             size=1)
```

## G Box-and-whisker plot

In this practical, we will explore the P_VACANT attribute of blocks
dataset in New Haven data.

Use of Histogram can be created using two options\
a. Standard approach OR\
b. Using ggplot

```{r}
# standard approach with hist
hist(blocks$P_VACANT, 
breaks = 40, 
col = "cyan", 
border = "salmon", 
main = "The distribution of vacant property percentages", 
xlab = "percentage vacant", 
xlim = c(0,40))
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2", dependencies = TRUE)
install.packages("tidyverse", dependencies = TRUE)

```

```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
data(newhaven)
# ggplot approach
ggplot(blocks@data, aes(P_VACANT)) +
  geom_histogram(col = "salmon", 
                 fill = "cyan", 
                 bins = 40) + 
  xlab("percentage vacant") +
  labs(title = "The distribution of vacant property percentages")
```

In this exercise, we will be using geom.\_boxplot function in the
ggplot2 package

To illustrate this

i\. we will split blocks dataset into high- and low-vacancy areas based
on whether the proportion of properties vacant is greater than 10%

ii\. Assigned to 2 (to consider as high) and 1 (to consider as low)

iii\. Use factor function to create two levels as "low" and "high"

a\. In ggplot function will use melt function in the reshape2 package
and it will take wide-format data and melts it into long-format data.

```{r}
library(reshape2)
# a logical test
index <- blocks$P_VACANT > 10
# assigned to 2 high, 1 low
blocks$vac <- index + 1
blocks$vac <- factor(blocks$vac, labels = c("Low", "High"))
#Then apply the geom_boxplot function:
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(melt(blocks@data[, c("P_OWNEROCC", "P_WHITE", "P_BLACK", "vac")]),
       aes(variable, value))+ 
  geom_boxplot() + facet_wrap(~vac)
```

## Exercise (4)

Create a similar box plot to illustrate the distribution of the vacant
("P_VACANT") and owner-occupied ("P_OWNEROCC") properties with respect
to the high and low populations ("POP1990") in the blocks.

## H Mosaic plot

Since the mosaic plots are used to visualize the statistical properties
between variables for this exercise we will plot vacant housing across
ethnic groups

a\. To draw mosaic plot we need ggmosaic package\
b. Select the relevant columns from block dataset\
c. Add column names to the dataset\
d. Create true/false for vacant properties\
e. Use xtabs() function to create cross-tabulation\
f. Use melt function from the reshape2 package to prepare data from
plotting\
g. Use stat_mosaic function and ggplot function to create the mosaic
plot

```{r eval= FALSE}
install.packages("ggmosaic", dep = T)
```

```{r}
# create the dataset
pops <- data.frame(blocks[,14:18]) ∗ data.frame(blocks)[,11]
pops <- as.matrix(pops/100)
colnames(pops) <- c("White", "Black", "Ameri", "Asian", "Other")

# a true / false for vacant properties
vac.10 <- (blocks$P_VACANT > 10)

# create a crosstabulation
mat.tab <- xtabs(pops ~vac.10)

# melt the data
df <- melt(mat.tab)

# load the packages
library(ggmosaic)

# call ggplot and stat_mosaic
ggplot(data = df) +
  stat_mosaic(aes(weight = value, 
                  x = product(Var2), 
                  fill=vac.10), 
              na.rm=TRUE) +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=−90, hjust= .1)) +
  labs(y='Proportion of Vacant Properties',
       x ='Ethnic group',
       title="Mosaic Plot of Vacant Properties with ethnicity") +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title = "> 10 percent", reverse = TRUE))
```
