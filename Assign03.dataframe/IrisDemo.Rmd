# Basics of R Programming (Data Frames)

Data Frames are perhaps the most commonly used data structures for data analytics. It is a 2-dimensional array. The following is the Iris flower dataset which consists of 5 columns. 4 columns with the attributes (Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width) of each data instance and the corresponding Iris Species (versicolor, virginica, setosa).


##Accessing Data Frames

Data Frames can be thought of as a collection of vectors where **each column is a vector**.

```{r}

#use the $ operator and the column name

#(case sensitive)

iris$Sepal.Length #5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5.0 ...

class(iris$Sepal.Length) #numeric


#alternatively

#this notation is useful for cases where the column

#name contain spaces

iris[["Sepal.Length"]] #5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5.0 ...

```

Since each column is just a vector, it is possible to use any vector operators we have covered in the previous exercise

```{r}

#get the first 3 values sepal lengths

iris$Sepal.Length[1:3] #5.1 4.9 4.7

```


Since Data Frames are 2D arrays, it is also possible to access the rows using **[ ]**. Just take note that we have to specify both the row index and column index (i.e. **[ROW_INDEX(ES), COLUMN_INDEX(ES)]**). Both row index(es) and column index(es) are optional.


```{r}

#get the 10th row

#take note of the ,

#if we don't specify the column index, it will return all columns

iris[10,]

#   Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species

#10          4.9         3.1          1.5         0.1  setosa


#get the first column

iris[,1] #5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5.0 ...


#can specify both to get a specific value

#this will get the 3rd column value of row 2

iris[2, 3] #1.4


#returns a data frame with the first 10 rows of the

#1st and 3rd column

iris[1:10, c(1,3)]

```

Similar to vector, we can also modify the values in the Data Frame. Some other common Data Frames operations include the following

```{r}

#remove a column

#by setting it to NULL

#this is useful for cases where we want to remove columns which

#are just ID value

irisCopy <- iris

irisCopy$Species <- NULL


#View() will display the data frame in RStudio like a spreadsheet

View(irisCopy)


#this will create a new column named Sepal.Length2

#with values that is twice of the Sepal.Length column

irisCopy$Sepal.Length2 <- irisCopy$Sepal.Length * 2


#alternatively we could do cbind()

#i.e. column binding

#note that it is possible for variable names to contain .

#this will create a dataframe by combining the iris dataset

#with a vector and the column is named Sepal.Length2

Sepal.Length2 <- irisCopy$Sepal.Length * 2

cbind(iris, Sepal.Length2)


#use rbind() to do row binding

#this will return a dataframe by combining

#the iris dataset with another row

newFlower <- c(5.0, 3.0, 1.5, 0.2, NA)

rbind(iris, newFlower)

```



## Column Names and Row Names

Note that each Data Frame has a set of column names and row names

```{r}

colnames(iris) #"Sepal.Length" "Sepal.Width"  "Petal.Length" "Petal.Width"  "Species"

rownames(iris) #"1" "2" "3" "4" "5" ...

```



It is also possible to modify the column and row names by assigning to **colnames() and rownames()**

```{r}

irisCopy <- iris

colnames(irisCopy) <- c("sepal_length", "sepal_width", "petal_length", "petal_width", "species")

colnames(irisCopy) #"sepal_length" "sepal_width"  "petal_length" "petal_width"  "species"


#typically row names should not be used for data modeling

#we could use the row names to better represent the data

#rather than just index values (1, 2, 3, etc)

rownames(irisCopy)[1] <- "first setosa"

View(irisCopy)

```


## Creating Data Frames

Apart from using rbind() and cbind(), data frames can also be initialized by **using vectors**.

```{r}

name <- c("john doe", "jane doe")

age <- c(20, 18)

data.frame(name, age)

#      name age
#1 john doe  20
#2 jane doe  18

```



## Reading and Writing Data

More commonly data is read into a Data Frame through a CSV file. We can use the **read.XXX()** functions to read in the relevant format (e.g. csv, table, spss) into a data frame. It can be a local file or from a URL. There is also the corresponding **write.XXX()** which will take in a Data Frame and write to a physical local in the working directory.

*Working directory is the main directory where we will be reading and writing files to if the absolute path is not specified*

```{r}

covidCases0101 <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports/01-01-2021.csv")

View(covidCases0101)


covidCases0101Simplified <- covidCases0101[, c("Country_Region", "Confirmed", "Deaths")]

#set working directory to c:\

setwd("D:/NUS/ChadCode/TBA2104/03dataframe")

write.csv(covidCases0101Simplified, "covid_01_01_2021.csv", row.names = F)


write.table(covidCases0101Simplified, "covid_01_01_2021.txt", row.names = F)

```



### Other Common Data Frame Operations

Data Frame is a very common data structure used in data analytics. Not just in R but also in other languages like Python (Pandas). Here are some examples of useful functions and details about Data Frames.


```{r}

#nrow() will return the number of rows

nrow(iris) #150


#ncol() will return the number of columns

ncol(iris) #5


#for vectors, there's a length() function to get the size

length(iris$Species) #150


#possible to filter the data frame using values

#this will return a new data frame with just the Setosa species

iris[iris$Species == "setosa",]

```
